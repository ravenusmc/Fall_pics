# fall-pics

> A project looking at fall pictures and maybe a few other things. I used the
following api for the project: Pexels which may be found at the following link:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/pexels-api-wrapper. This is my first project using
the VUE-CLI. It originally was supposed to be a small project but as I learned
more about VUE I've expanded it out. 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
