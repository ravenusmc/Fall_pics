# fall-pics

> A project looking at fall pictures and maybe a few other things. I used the
following api for the project: Pexels which may be found at the following link:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/pexels-api-wrapper. This is my first project using
the VUE-CLI. It originally was supposed to be a small project but as I learned
more about VUE I've expanded it out. The ultimate goal will be to use some VUEX and
add some graphs of weather data. Well see how it turns out.

## Build Setup
